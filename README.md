Hydrate Detection Challenge üßä
Challenge Statement üèãÔ∏è
Imagine you are a lease operator at EOG, tasked with ensuring optimal production from a group of wells. One of the challenges you face is the formation of hydrates (ice-like solids made of frozen natural gas) that can form inside pipelines and block the injection of gas. This blockage can significantly reduce oil production and potentially lead to costly well shutdowns.

As a lease operator, your goal is to efficiently monitor these wells and quickly identify any instances of hydrate formation. You have access to data streams that include the current gas injection volume, target gas injection volume, and valve open percentage. Your challenge is to develop a solution that makes it easy and quick to detect when a hydrate occurs, allowing the lease operator to take swift action to minimize production loss.

Extension: Given data from an unseen well, enhance your solution by predicting when a hydrate is likely to form.

Prizes will be awarded to the 2 best teams for this category, please come and see the EOG Resources team for more details.
